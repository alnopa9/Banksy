      <description>An eye-catching stencil by Banksy of a girl being grabbed by the robotic arm of a cash machine, appeared close to Exmouth Market in North London. The message appears to be anti-capitalist, with Banksy perhaps taking a shot at high street banks luring customers in versus local banks barely surviving.

      <description>One of Banksy's recognisable pieces in 2006. It shows a woman dressed as a maid who is sweeping dirt under the cover of a brick wall.

      <name>Swing Girl</name>
      <description>Swing Girl is another example of Banksy making use of what was already there. The ‘ing’ portion of the parking sign have been whitewashed out to form park and a girl on a swing added to the letter A. It seems clear on what he is trying to say as there is a lack of places for kids to play safely in what is a fairly rough area of LA. Located in a car park on Broadway, Downtown LA.<br/>

      <name>Thug for Life Bunny</name>
      <description>Banksy’s Thug For Life Bunny was originally in London, but has since been painted over. In this piece, Banksy style the cute bunny seems at odds with the cigar and excessive bling more suited to hip hop artists. To me it is a comment on how the younger generations are being lured into this thug lifestyle that is being shown in the media today.<br/>
