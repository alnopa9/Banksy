        <name>Abraham Lincoln</name>
        <description>This piece by Banksy called Abraham Lincoln is another of the works that appeared in the city around the 3rd anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and all of them seemed to comment on the slow reconstruction of the city. Banksy represented Lincoln as a homeless man, but the dilapidated building that it was once painted on is long gone.</description>

        <description>This piece by Banksy is one of his earliest paintings in the San Fransisco area and is well preserved despite the city’s hard line policy when it comes to removing street art. The baby carriage is seen falling down stairs, which are actually the remnants of where real stairs once stood. It highlights the parents being careless with there child in a city this big.</description>

        <name>Banksy VS Bristol</name>
        <description>“In the summer of 2009 Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery was taken over by an extraordinary exhibition of works by the infamous Bristol artist Banksy. Overnight the museum was transformed into a menagerie of Unnatural History – fishfingers swimming in a gold-fish bowl, hot-dogs and chicken nuggets. Paintings were placed in amongst the historic collections of Old Masters, sculptures and other pieces dotted around throughout the museum displays. The main entrance was transformed into a sculpture hall, accompanied by a burnt out ice-cream van that pumped out an eerie sound-track of warped tunes, whilst a giant ice-cream melted on its roof. Before long, people queued around the block to get into the exhibition, some as long as seven hours just to be part of this unique phenomenon. Over 100 works by the artist – most of which had not been shown before – were displayed. Banksy left one sculpture behind. Pictured above is the Angel Bust – or the paint-pot angel which is currently on display at the museum. He also gave another work to the museum of a sculpture of Jerusalem, which was made by another artist called Tawfiq Salsaa – you can see it in our online collection.” Source: Bristol Museum</description>

        <description>Barely Legal was the third major exhibition after Turf War and Crude Oils. It was held in a warehouse in Los Angeles on the weekend of 16 September 2006. Billed as a “three-day vandalised warehouse extravaganza”. The exhibition featured a live “elephant in a room,” painted in a pink and gold floral wallpaper pattern, which, according to leaflets handed out at the exhibition, was intended to draw attention to the issue of world poverty. Banksy continues exploring the “modified oils” genre from the previous exhibition “Crude Oils”.</description>

        <name>Better Out Than In</name>
        <description>On 1 October, Banksy began a one-month “show on the streets of New York”, for which he opened a separate website and twitter account. On every day for the rest of the month, he produced one street art piece in different locations. A pop-up boutique of about 25 spray-art canvases appeared on Fifth Avenue near Central Park on 12 October. Tourists were able to buy Banksy art for just $60 each. In a note posted to his website, the artist wrote: “Please note this was a one-off. The stall will not be there again.” The BBC estimated that the street-stall art pieces could be worth as much as $31,000. The booth was manned by an unknown elderly man who went about four hours before making a sale, yawning and eating lunch as people strolled by without a second glance at the work. Banksy chronicled the surprise sale in a video posted to his website noting, “Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each.” Two of the canvasses sold at a July 2014 auction for $214,000.</description>

It was soon covered with other works, such is the ever changing nature of the tunnel. It is an ironic piece that showed ancient cave paintings being cleaned by a council worker, highlighting how art is often destroyed by those who don’t understand it.</description>

The theme of weapons and children is a recurring are in a lot of Banksy’s pieces.This child soldier having a machine gun appeared in Los Angeles on a wall of “Urban Outfitters” although it didn’t last long before it was vandalised with paint. The piece is an attempt to highlight the corrupted innocence of children and it is not uncommon to see children having guns and involved in conflicts in highly volatile parts of the world.

The film charts Guetta’s constant documenting of his every waking moment on film, from a chance encounter with his cousin, the artist Invader, to his introduction to a host of street artists with a focus on Shepard Fairey and Banksy, whose anonymity is preserved by obscuring his face and altering his voice, to Guetta’s eventual fame as a street artist himself. The film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2010, and it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.</description>

Several versions of the boy were seen around Salt Lake City and Park City, but this particular one was painted over.</description>

        <description>This piece by Banksy called Mobile Phone Lovers caused a stir when it appeared close to a boys club in Banksy’s home town of Bristol. The owner of the club removed the door with the intention of using it to raise funds for his club, but it was taken from him by the local council who claimed ownership. However the issue was resolved when Banksy himself sent a letter to the club seeming to condone his choice to use it as a fundraiser. This piece represents this generation.</description>

As we walked through a tunnel in Shoreditch someone said – You’re wasting your time, why would you want to paint pictures in a dump like this?”</description>

        <description>Girl and a Soldier is one of the 2007 pieces that Banksy put up on a wall in Bethlehem. The little girl is seen frisking an armed soldier in diffrent types of roles to get what she wants. This along with other images on the wall were intended to promote the annual Santa’s Ghetto exhibit. The piece is still visible although somewhat faded today.</description>

        <name>Stormtroopers Filming Oscars</name>
        <description>Banksy enjoys putting people and objects in unexpected scenarios and here the usually menacing stormtroopers appear somewhat comical in their setting as camera man an presenters. It seems fitting that this piece was part of a larger mural found in Hollywood – home of the movies! There is still some debate over whether or not this is in fact a Banksy or the work of another artists going by ‘Mr Brainwash’.</description>

        <name>Sweep it Under the Carpet</name>
        <description>One of Banksy's recognisable pieces in 2006. It shows a woman dressed as a maid who is sweeping dirt under the cover of a brick wall. The piece is said to represent the western world to deal with global issues such as the AIDS epidemic as being the main issue in 2006. On Chalk Fun Road in North London.</description>

        <description>Swing Girl is another example of Banksy making use of what was already there. The ‘ing’ portion of the parking sign have been whitewashed out to form park and a girl on a swing added to the letter A. It seems clear on what he is trying to say as there is a lack of places for kids to play safely in what is a fairly rough area of LA. Located in a car park on Broadway, Downtown LA.</description>

        <description>This Banksy work was found in Hastings by showing a young child building sandcastles. This in itself is not controversial, but when we notice that Tesco is printed on the sandcastles it takes on a new meaning. This is a common theme in Banksy’s work and here he seems to be indicating that the supermarket giant is taking over the country! The artwork is still visible on the Sea wall although it has been defaced by other graffitti artists.</description>

        <name>The Segregation Wall</name>
        <description>In August 2005 Team Banksy visited Palestine where they painted seven large murals on the segregation wall. Banksy’s feelings about the barrier are made explicit in a statement which says the wall “essentially turns Palestine into the world’s largest open prison.” On Banksy’s website, readers are reminded that Israel’s 425-mile-long West Bank barrier, separating Israel from the Palestinian territories, is considered illegal by the United Nations. During the visit to Ramallah and surrounding areas, Banksy reports some tense moments. His spokeswoman Jo Brooks said: “The Israeli security forces did shoot in the air threateningly and there were quite a few guns pointed at him.”</description>

This led many to accuse Banksy of selling out, but it showed an example of his work. Ironically, due to a ban on all graffiti related posters by London Transport, Blur had difficulty advertising the album thanks to Banksy’s cover art!</description>

The prosecution mocked him as ‘no Banksy’ due to a lack of artistry in his tagging. In response Banksy put up the piece which shows a little boy writing ‘Tox’ in bubbles. People are not sure whether this is a show of solidarity or being used to poke fun at Halpin.</description>

Marks the beginning of a string of brilliant exhibitions with a periodicity of approximately two years. Turf War in 2003, Crude Oils, 2005, Barely Legal, 2006, Banksy vs Bristol Museum 2009, etc. The live cows and sheep are transported from the Somerset farm. There is also a section of “modified oils”, the most prominent being “Suicide bombers just need a hug”. The London art critics call the exhibitions one of the most interesting of the year.</description>
