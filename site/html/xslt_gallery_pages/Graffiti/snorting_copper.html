            This artwork shows the police officers in London snorting a line of coke.This artworks also included several miles of paint “dribble” which trailed through the city and led to the stencil representing a line of coke. This piece by Banksy is strongly taking shots at the cops by lacking immorality and corruption in the police force. This artwork was vandalized but hsa been brought back to restoration. On Curtain Road at the Waterloo Station in London.
