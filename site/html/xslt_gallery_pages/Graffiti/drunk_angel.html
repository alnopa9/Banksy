            This piece by Banksy Drunk Angel, was first spotted on London Bridge although it has since been painted over. It shows a fallen angel, tied and weary. The bottle suggests alcohol and the angel is also smoking. Banksy seems to be saying that despite his best efforts the angel has failed and ended up turning to substance abuse by not helping himself.
