                  <span class="desc">This piece of Banksy became super popular as it spread everywhere.This piece was discovered in Melbourne. It shows a homeless man who appears to be asking for change but not in the physical change â€“ as he says, he wants social change rather than coins/bills. Its a strong piece with a deep meaning as he wants society to change for the better. On a street outide of a building in Melbourne Australia.
