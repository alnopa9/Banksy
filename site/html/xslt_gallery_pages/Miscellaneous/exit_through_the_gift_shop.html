                     <p>The film tells the story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in Los Angeles, and
                        his obsession with street art. The film charts Guetta’s constant documenting of his
                        every waking moment on film, from a chance encounter with his cousin, the artist Invader,
                        to his introduction to a host of street artists with a focus on Shepard Fairey and
                        Banksy, whose anonymity is preserved by obscuring his face and altering his voice,
                        to Guetta’s eventual fame as a street artist himself. The film premiered at the 2010
                        Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2010, and it was nominated for the Academy Award
                        for Best Documentary Feature.
