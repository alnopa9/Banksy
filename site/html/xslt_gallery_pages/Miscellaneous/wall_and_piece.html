                     <p>Artistic genius, political activist, painter and decorator, mythic legend or notorious
                        graffiti artist - the work of Banksy is unmistakable, except maybe when it's squatting
                        inthe Tate or New York's Metropolitan Museum. Banksy is responsible for decorating
                        the streets, walls, bridges and zoos of towns and cites throughout the world. Witty
                        and subversive, his stencils show monkeys with weapons of mass destruction, policeman
                        with smiley faces, rats with drills and umbrellas. If you look hard enough you'll
                        find your own. His statements, incitements, ironies and epigrams are by turns intelligent
                        and cheeky comments on everything from the monarchy and capitalism to the war in Iraq
                        and farm animals. His identity remains unknown, but his work is prolific. This volume
                        brings together the best of his work.
