                        <p>Artistic genius, political activist, painter and decorator, mythic legend or notorious
                           graffiti artist - the work of Banksy is unmistakable, except maybe when it's squatting
                           inthe Tate or New York's Metropolitan Museum. Banksy is responsible for decorating
                           the streets, walls, bridges and zoos of towns and cites throughout the world. Witty
                           and subversive, his stencils show monkeys with weapons of mass destruction, policeman
                           with smiley faces, rats with drills and umbrellas. If you look hard enough you'll
                           find your own. His statements, incitements, ironies and epigrams are by turns intelligent
                           and cheeky comments on everything from the monarchy and capitalism to the war in Iraq
                           and farm animals. His identity remains unknown, but his work is prolific. This volume
                           brings together the best of his work.
