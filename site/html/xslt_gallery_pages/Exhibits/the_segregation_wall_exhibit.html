                        <p>In August 2005 Team Banksy visited Palestine where they painted seven large murals
                           on the segregation wall. Banksy’s feelings about the barrier are made explicit in
                           a statement which says the wall “essentially turns Palestine into the world’s largest
                           open prison.” On Banksy’s website, readers are reminded that Israel’s 425-mile-long
                           West Bank barrier, separating Israel from the Palestinian territories, is considered
                           illegal by the United Nations. During the visit to Ramallah and surrounding areas,
                           Banksy reports some tense moments. His spokeswoman Jo Brooks said: “The Israeli security
                           forces did shoot in the air threateningly and there were quite a few guns pointed
                           at him.”
