                     <p>In August 2005 Team Banksy visited Palestine where they painted seven large murals
                        on the segregation wall. Banksy’s feelings about the barrier are made explicit in
                        a statement which says the wall “essentially turns Palestine into the world’s largest
                        open prison.” On Banksy’s website, readers are reminded that Israel’s 425-mile-long
                        West Bank barrier, separating Israel from the Palestinian territories, is considered
                        illegal by the United Nations. During the visit to Ramallah and surrounding areas,
                        Banksy reports some tense moments. His spokeswoman Jo Brooks said: “The Israeli security
                        forces did shoot in the air threateningly and there were quite a few guns pointed
                        at him.”
