         <name>Bomb Hugger</name>
         <description>The picture of a young girl hugging a bomb to her chest is one of Banksy’s original
            creations back in 2003, where it was made on a wall in London’s East End. 
            The piece symbolises the horror of warby being innocence and as young girl by having
            nothing to do with it as being good or evil.– 
            .

         <name>Cash Machine Girl</name>
         <description>An eye-catching stencil by Banksy of a girl being grabbed by the robotic arm of a
            cash machine, appeared close to Exmouth Market in North London. 
            The message appears to be anti-capitalist, with Banksy perhaps taking a shot at high
            street banks luring customers in versus local banks barely surviving.

         <name>Child Soldier</name>
         <description>This was one of Banksy's big paintings in Hollywood. The theme of weapons and children
            is a recurring are in a lot of Banksy’s pieces.This child soldier having a machine
            
            gun appeared in Los Angeles on a wall of “Urban Outfitters” although it didn’t last
            long before it was vandalised with paint. 
            The piece is an attempt to highlight the corrupted innocence of children and it is
            not uncommon to see children having guns and involved in conflicts in highly volatile
            parts of the world.

         <description> This piece of Bnanksy became super popular as it spread everywhere.This piece was
            discovered in Melbourne. It shows a homeless man who appears to be asking for change
            but not in the physical change – 
            as he says, he wants social change rather than coins/bills. Its a strong piece with
            a deep meaning as he wants society to change for the better.

         <description>Banksy’s ‘Gangsta Rat’ was first spotted w at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London in

            cap 
            symbolizes the society as it went from innocent looking to a "gangsta"type of looking
            by making the society worse.

         <name>Graffiti is a Crime</name>
         <description>Graffiti Is a Crime is the first of Banksy’s pieces in New York City in October 2013.
            The piece incorporates his distinctive  
            technique and pokes fun at the law by incorporating an anti-graffiti sign. However,
            within hours of it being posted on Banksy’s Instagram profile, the sign 
            had been stolen and by the next day city officials had painted over the work.

         <description>This Banksy art piece shows a salesman with an aim to attack the a capitalist society
            where respect for people can often be viewed as less important than commodities. 
            The graffiti lasted only a couple of days before it was painted over by store staff.
            It shows that he wants people to underatnd other human beings as well.

         <description>This piece is diffrent from his others becasue of the location, its not seen at a
            busy place for people to take notice.It shows little boy in the act of painting the
            slogan, as an 
            act to show society that everyone matters no matter what.This piece however has currently
            removed.
