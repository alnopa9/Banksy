        <desc>This piece by Banksy called Waiting in Vain is another part of his New York residency ‘Better Our Than In’. It appeared on the roll down shutters of Larry Flint’s Hustler club and depicts a man with flowers who has apparently been stood up – perhaps by one of the dancers?. 
            The shutter has been removed for display inside the club</desc>
