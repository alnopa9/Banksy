        <desc>This piece by Banksy was discovered towards the end of 2011, Sorry! The lifestyle you ordered is currently out of stock appears on the side of an empty building believed to be a failed housing project stalled by the recession. 
            It is still visible today although it has some streaks of black paint over it. It shows that no one can live a perfect life or have one just like yours.</desc>
