        <desc>This piece by Banksy shows a Fridge Kite by a child flying a kite, but it is actually a fridge. It has been suggested that this represents hunger and poverty. 
            However, the child is still finding a way to be a child despite this. It shows the power of limitation that a child can have. This work has since been destroyed.</desc>
