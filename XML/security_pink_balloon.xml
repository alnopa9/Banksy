        <desc>This piece, showing a security guard officer with a dog on a leash consisting of a pink balloon, was discovered at the rear of a police headquarters in the province of Ontario, Canada. Sadly, it was vandalised just a few days later. It showed that the police was soft on the criminals recently being released from jail. In front of OPP Headquarters in Toronto Ontario.</desc>
