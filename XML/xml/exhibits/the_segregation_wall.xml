            <p>In August 2005 Team Banksy visited Palestine where they painted seven large murals on the segregation wall. Banksy’s feelings about the barrier are made explicit in a statement which says the wall “essentially turns Palestine into the world’s largest open prison.” On Banksy’s website, readers are reminded that Israel’s 425-mile-long West Bank barrier, separating Israel from the Palestinian territories, is considered illegal by the United Nations. During the visit to Ramallah and surrounding areas, Banksy reports some tense moments. His spokeswoman Jo Brooks said: “The Israeli security forces did shoot in the air threateningly and there were quite a few guns pointed at him.”</p>
