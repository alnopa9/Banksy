        <desc>This piece by Banksy called Abraham Lincoln is another of the works that appeared in the city around the 3rd anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and all of them seemed to comment on the slow reconstruction of the city. 
            Banksy represented Lincoln as a homeless man, but the dilapidated building that it was once painted on is long gone.</desc>
