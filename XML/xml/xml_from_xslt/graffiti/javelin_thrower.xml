        <desc>During the 2012 Olympics in London, Banksy created this piece known as ‘Welcome to Hackney’ or ‘Javelin Thrower’ as it shows an athlete throwing a missile. This is in protest of the decision to add surface to air missile launchers on top of some residential 
            tower blocks in the city as part of the security measures during the games.</desc>
