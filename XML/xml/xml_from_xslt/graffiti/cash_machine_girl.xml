        <desc>An eye-catching stencil by Banksy of a girl being grabbed by the robotic arm of a cash machine, appeared close to Exmouth Market in North London. 
            The message appears to be anti-capitalist, with Banksy perhaps taking a shot at high street banks luring customers in versus local banks barely surviving. In front of Exmouth Market, on a wall in North London.</desc>
