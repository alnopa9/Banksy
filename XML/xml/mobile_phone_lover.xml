        <desc>This piece by Banksy called Mobile Phone Lovers caused a stir when it appeared close to a boys club in Banksyâ€™s home town of Bristol. The owner of the club removed the door with the intention of using it to raise funds for his club, but it was taken from him by the local council who claimed ownership. 
            However the issue was resolved when Banksy himself sent a letter to the club seeming to condone his choice to use it as a fundraiser. This piece represents this generation. </desc>
