        <desc>Forgive us our trespassing was one of several pieces completed in the run up to the premiere of Banksy’s ‘Exit Through the Gift Shop’ at the 2010 Sundance Festival in Utah. 
            It shows a young boy seemingly seeking forgiveness for his act of Vandalism and some suggest it refers to Banksy’s own conflicted feelings about his work. 
            Several versions of the boy were seen around Salt Lake City and Park City, but this particular one was painted over.</desc>
