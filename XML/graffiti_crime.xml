        <desc>Graffiti Is a Crime is the first of Banksy’s pieces in New York City in October 2013. The piece incorporates his distinctive  
            technique and pokes fun at the law by incorporating an anti-graffiti sign. However, within hours of it being posted on Banksy’s Instagram profile, the sign 
            had been stolen and by the next day city officials had painted over the work. On Allen Street in New York City.</desc>
