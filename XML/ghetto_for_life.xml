        <desc>This piece by Banksy called Ghetto for Life which appeared in the Brooklyn, the majority of residents found the work to be offensive saying that it helps to perpetuate stereotypes. 
            It seems many have focused on the words and not the artwork which depicts a little boy spraying the words and being waited on by a butler. 
            Banksy seems to be saying that the ‘ghetto’ image is just that – an image used for style purposes. 
            That didn’t stop people flocking to see it and the building’s owner employed guards to protect it!</desc>
