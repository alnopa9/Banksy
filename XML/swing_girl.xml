        <desc>Swing Girl is another example of Banksy making use of what was already there. The ‘ing’ portion of the parking sign have been whitewashed out to form park and a girl on a swing added to the letter A. 
            It seems clear on what he is trying to say as there is a lack of places for kids to play safely in what is a fairly rough area of LA. Located in a car park on Broadway, Downtown LA.</desc>
