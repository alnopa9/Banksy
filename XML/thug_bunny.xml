        <desc>Banksyâ€™s Thug For Life Bunny was originally in London, but has since been painted over. In this piece, Banksy style the cute bunny seems at odds with the cigar and excessive bling more suited to hip hop artists. 
           To me it is a comment on how the younger generations are being lured into this thug lifestyle that is being shown in the media today.</desc>
