# Banksy
Banksy is an anonymous graffiti artist who is known for his politically inspired art.
Our goal for this project is to start a database for his works, geotag their locations,
and create a timeline.
Using KML (keyhole markup language) we aim to create an overlay that pinpoints each
location that Banksy has left a tag.
We will also look for frequencies in his tagging by looking at where and how often 
does he tag in a certain country and how many times has he referenced different causes.
